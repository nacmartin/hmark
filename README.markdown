Hmark
==========================

Hmark is a very simple web application to share bookmarks written in Haskell+Happstack that I wrote during to learn Haskell.

It has two urls:

  localhost:3000?url=http://url.to.save.com 

Saves http://url.to.save.com  in the database

  localhost:3000

Redirects you to the last saved bookmark.

That is all!
